#OdishaScraping
This project is a multi-threaded web scraper using selenium
The odishascraping/README.txt has the instructions to run the program
the scraper pulls data from district level information for the Indian Province
of Odisha. 
This is a project I continue to work on for Prof. Pradeep Chhibber's Political Science research group at UC Berkeley.
